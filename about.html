      <h2>Welcome to Taste Haven</h2>
      <p>
      Taste Haven is a passion project ignited by an unexpected romantic spark from an unassuming encounter between two chefs inside a Manila diner with a reputation. Born on opposite sides of the world – Italy and the Philippines –  they decided to bridge together their cuisines that they have learned as their master craft as an expression of both skill and love. With their success over the years, Taste Haven has become a place where people of all ages can eat a meal, where they can feel a little bit less alone in the world. The founder chefs of Taste Haven wish that when each person takes a bite out of the meals made from their recipes, a fond memory is made to be remembered by the customer, just like how our two founders built up Taste Haven all those years ago.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
       Taste Haven was made to bring customers the special feeling of “home” to each and every customer they serve. This is the mission our founders swore by when they tasted each other’s food for the very first time. Our Italian founder wanted to share that unforgettable moment of the day on their first vacation to the Philippines. In return, our Filipino founder shared the same sentiment when they went to visit Italy. Together, they have built the bridge over the gap between Filipino and Italian cuisine. With Taste Haven, their customers can have the privilege to cross that bridge.

	<h2>About Our Founders</h2>
	<h3>Angelica Mazzanti</h3>
	<p>
	Angelica Mazzanti is a self-made entrepreneur from Sicily, Italy. Before coming to the Philippines, she was one of the chosen to inherit the property of the Mazzanti’s tomato and grape farms. Her successful networking in Manila earned the approval of the then-head of the Mazzanti family, her mother, Annetta Mazzanti. Even as the current head of the family, Annetta will never change her mind about the one true gift Manila has offered her on that faithful day.
	</p>
	<h3>Elias Ramos Mazzanti</h3>
	<p>
	Elias was born in Cavite, Philippines, and raised on a coffee farm tended by his parents. The coffee farm became a steady supplier to a number of restaurants and cafes in the local region. With the money, Elias was able to graduate with a degree in culinary arts and a minor in business, as advised by his parents. It proved to be good advice indeed, as it gave him the skills Elias needed in his career when his parents’ coffee farm was forced to be sold since their clients wanted to seek alternatives that followed the trends. It was weeks after the farm was sold when Elias was climbing up the culinary ladder when an Italian lady wanted to give her best compliments to the chef personally for his amazing cooking. Now, with the life he shares together with Angelica, Elias took her last name on the day of their marriage out of love and respect, and also gratitude for helping take back his parents’ coffee farm that raised him into the man that he is today.
