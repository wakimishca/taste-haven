      <h2>Welcome to Taste Haven</h2>
      <p>
      Taste Haven is a passion project ignited by an unexpected romantic spark from an unassuming encounter between two chefs inside a small-time Manila diner. Born on opposite sides of the world – Italy and the Philippines –  they decided to bridge together their cuisines that they have learned as their master craft as an expression of both skill and love. With their success over the years, Taste Haven has become a place where people of all ages can eat a meal, where they can feel a little bit less alone in the world. The founder chefs of Taste Haven wish that when each person takes a bite out of the meals made from their recipes, a fond memory is made to be remembered by the customer. Just like how our two founders built up Taste Haven all those years ago.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
       Taste Haven was made to bring customers the special feeling of “home” to each and every customer they serve. This is the mission our founders swore by when they tasted each other’s food for the very first time. Our Italian founder wanted to share that unforgettable moment of the day on their first vacation to the Philippines. In return, our Filipino founder shared the same sentiment when they went to visit Italy. Together, they have built the bridge over the gap between Filipino and Italian cuisine. With Taste Haven, their customers can have the privilege to cross that bridge.
