        <h2>1992</h2>
        <p>An Italian entrepreneur visits the Philippines for a vacation, and one day decides to dine in one of the local restaurants in the bustling city of Manila. The said entrepreneur becomes enamored with the flavors of Filipino food and offers the chef their best compliments. It became the beginning words for a romantic story shared over a shared passion for cuisine.</p>

        <p>Over the years, they’ve decided to share a piece of that passion with the world by opening a restaurant here in Manila serving food from both of their cultures. The name “Taste Haven” was chosen by the Italian entrepreneur because of the feeling of home they felt when they first tasted the food cooked by their partner.
